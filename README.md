# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to detect breast cancer by classifying tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using diagnostic data. The notebook walks through a complete ML pipeline — from loading and analyzing the data to training and evaluating multiple classification models.

## 📁 Files Included

- **`Breast Cancer.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data loading and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature selection and standardization  
  - Training models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors)  
  - Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve  
  - Model comparison and conclusions

- **`data.csv`**  
  Diagnostic dataset based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It contains:
  - 569 samples  
  - 30 numerical features  
  - Diagnosis labels: `M` for malignant, `B` for benign
