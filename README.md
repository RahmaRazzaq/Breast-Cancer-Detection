## ü©∫ Breast Cancer Detection ‚Äì ML Classification Project

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used for early detection of breast cancer using a structured classification approach. The notebook `Breast Cancer.ipynb` walks through the entire pipeline ‚Äî from data loading to model evaluation ‚Äî using the dataset `data.csv`, which is based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

### üìÇ Project Files

* **`Breast Cancer.ipynb`**
  A Jupyter Notebook that covers:

  * Data loading and cleaning
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Feature selection and scaling
  * Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)
  * Final comparison and conclusions

* **`data.csv`**
  Contains 569 patient records with 30 numerical features per sample, such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and a target variable indicating diagnosis (`M` = malignant, `B` = benign).

### üîç Highlights

* Clean and readable code for ML beginners
* Clear explanation of data science workflow
* Use of Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
* Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Well-commented steps for learning and reproducibility

### üß™ Tools Used

* Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notebook
