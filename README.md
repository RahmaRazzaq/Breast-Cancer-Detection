# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to detect breast cancer by classifying tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using diagnostic data. The notebook walks through a complete ML pipeline — from loading and analyzing the data to training and evaluating multiple classification models.
